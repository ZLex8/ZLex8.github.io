<header><h2>Understanding the Impermanence of Who You Are Now</h2></header>
<p>So many live trapped in the illusion that they must define themselves with permanence. But what if identity was never meant to be fixed? What if change is not a loss of self, but a return to your fluid nature?</p>

<p>This is a call for you to  observe yourself with awareness, not attachment. Every reaction, every thought loop, every habit is part of a greater rhythm that can be seen, felt, and shifted. The key is not to judge, but to become conscious of the pattern. </p>

<p>When you begin to witness the impermanence of the current self, a quiet freedom emerges. You no longer cling to who youâ€™ve been, and you no longer fear who you might become.</p>
 
<p>In that surrender, transformation begins. You shed layers, not because they were wrong, but because they were temporary. Outgrown. Understood.</p>
