<h3>What is the energy of today?</h3>
<p>The energy today is a quiet guide, urging presence over pressure. It invites you to slow down, observe without judgment, and return to your center. </p>


<h3>What part of yourself have you been ignoring lately?</h3>
<p>Maybe it's the quiet part that craves rest or the bold part that wants to speak but stays silent. In the rush of life, you've put pieces of yourself on pause. They're still there, waiting to be felt again.</p>



<h3>What does your inner voice sound like right now?</h3>
<p>Is it kind or distant, loud or fading? That voice reflects how you’ve been treating yourself. Listen to it without judgement.</p>


<h3>You are not lost, you are recalibrating.</h3>
<p>Drifting doesn’t mean failing. You’re simply pausing, adjusting, realigning with who you’re becoming. Give yourself permission to move slowly.</p>


<h3>Andromeda reminds you: Without oblivion, there is no becoming.</h3>
<p>Oblivion isn’t the end, but a clearing. In letting go, you create space to grow. You’re not fading, you’re transforming.</p>


<h3>Stars burn out before they're reborn.</h3>
<p>Even the brightest need to collapse before they shine again. Let yourself dim. Your light will never be gone.</p>
