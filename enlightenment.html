<p>
<li><strong> Don't be a stranger to yourself. Know your consciousness.</strong><br />
Because the more you avoid your inner world, the more disconnected you become from your truth. Knowing your consciousness is the first step toward living with clarity, purpose, and alignment.
</p>
<p>
<li><strong>Life becomes beautiful once you get out of your own way.</strong><br />
When you step aside and allow your true self to lead, life flows with more ease, beauty, and meaning.
</li>
</p>
<p>
<li><strong>You are not your thoughts.</strong><br />
The awareness that notices them is constant. That awareness is you.
</li>
</p>
<p>
<li><strong>You can't control many situations. But you can control how you experience them.</strong><br />
You can't change what happens, but you can change what it means to you.
</li>
</p>
<p>
<li><strong>Don't resist discomfort. What you resist will persist.</strong><br />
Resistance gives it power.
</li>
</p>
<p>
<li><strong>The mind cannot be forced to stay quiet.</strong><br />
It can only be detached from enough times to the point where it stops using its energy to get a reaction out of you
</li>
</p>
<p>
<li><strong>The living and enjoying your life part is just as important as the lesson learning part.</strong><br />
Living fully means allowing space for both the lessons and the experiences that make life real.
</li>
